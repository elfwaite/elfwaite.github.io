              <p style= "letter-spacing: 4px; font-size:18px"><strong>CLOUD COMPUTING</strong></p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">Throughout the project we did extenive research and discussed the aspects of this website, its capabilities and its progress. The following are those discussions.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">Throughout the majority of this project we utilised cloud-computing to store, access and collaborate on various files. Cloud computing definitely provides a number of advantages when working in a group situation - the ability to easily access files, the possibility to edit work stored in the cloud (google drive) and the lessened risk of losing files/work to name a few.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">The accessibility of cloud computing is something that is incredibly beneficial - having the ability to access files wherever you are means that you don’t have worry about the possibility of losing access to your computer (the device is lost, damaged, crashes etc.). If you’re not using cloud computing, losing access to your laptop means losing access to your files (unless you regularly back up on an external hard-drive - even then, this still requires you to transfer these files to another laptop or desktop computer). Having the ability to store files in the cloud means that you can access them immediately from almost any device. For example, if I was working on a file on Google Docs (linked to Google Drive) but I left my laptop at home, I would still be able to access those same files and edit them at school using either a school laptop or my smartphone - there would be no need to find and transfer files and I would be able to continue working without interruption. Files on uploaded on a cloud computing solution can be accessed from anywhere and at any time - as long as you have permission.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">Cloud computing solutions also lessen the chances of losing a file. Having a document or image uploaded onto Google Drive, iCloud or Dropbox minimises the risk of losing access to a file through accidental (or purposeful) deletion.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">Cloud computing also allows the user to easily collaborate with other people using the same file - this is a particularly predominant feature with Google Drive which also allows multiple users to edit a file at once. However, even when using another company - such as DropBox - as a cloud computing solution, the ability to share and collaboratively work on a file is heightened. A file on Dropbox can be opened and edited, syncing every time you save. This means that other members in your group almost always have access to the most recent version of that file. Google Drive provides an extension on this, allowing users to edit the same document at the same time - this ensures that the document that is viewed is always the most up-to-date version. Google Drive also allows any of the editors to track changes meaning that all members can see who is contributing effectively and who is not.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">However, like almost every technological solution it does come with it’s drawbacks - issues arise as it is entirely based entirely online (despite the possibility to download files, it does mean we are reliant on the internet to access these), there is no way to the guarantee security of these images (in the last year a number of celebrities have been targeted with private photos being leaked to the public).</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="font-weight:lighter; font-size:15px">Using cloud based software also help us as a team all contribute to the product. This gave us the ability to work as a team even when separated. In this task we used many different applications some of which being MindMeister and Google Drive with its corresponding apps. This has given us the capability to work well together and produce the work we have. Using these digital systems means that the group is given the widest array of results and research possible to find the best conclusion attainable. In our group all work was written out in a document and then shared out between the members. Because everyone had access to each document there was no misconception on who had to do what and by what point. The work when complete was recorded on a gantt chart to see when each part was complete and by who. Work was also completed in shared documents so everyone had access to it and could help/critique it. This meant all work is completed at the highest quality possible. Once work was divided there where due dates and requirements for each member to comply with. This then made sure all work was done on time and to a good standard. The physical design of the web browser was verbally discussed online but only physically shown/explained when the team met up. Because it was in person and on paper this meant that the team could visualise and change the design with the flick of the wrist giving us the desired result in the view of the entire team even though only one member was coding it.</p>
